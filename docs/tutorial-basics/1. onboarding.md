# Onboarding

Embarking on the onboarding journey is your gateway to kickstarting your organization with Woodcore. Our dedicated support team is with you every step of the way, from the initial introduction to ensuring your organization is seamlessly migrated to Woodcore and ready to roll live!


## Initiating Contact and System Overview

To connect with us initially, simply fill out a form accessible on our website. This form gathers crucial details such as your organization profile, use case, and contact information. It serves as a tool for expressing your interest and helps us furnish you with comprehensive information about Woodcore's product offerings.

Once we receive your submitted form, a representative from our team will reach out to schedule a meeting. This meeting serves as our first interaction, allowing us to present our product, understand your specific use case, and explore how Lithobase can be tailored to meet your service requirements.

During this initial introduction, we will guide you through a demonstration of the Lithobase system as a whole, covering both the API and the console.


## SLA Agreement and Billing

Should you decide to move forward with Lithobase, we'll send an invoice to your organization's billing contact via email for the required payments. Additionally, you'll need to sign a Service-Level Agreement (SLA) along with other necessary Non-Disclosure documents provided by Lithobase. Once these formalities are successfully addressed, we're all set to kick off your integration and configuration process.


### Testing Time!

Now, it's time to play around with a special place made just for you called the 'test environment.' Imagine it like a playground where you can try out all the cool features and see how everything works. It helps you understand the system better.

This playground actually has two parts:

The first part is where you can test things and learn how to use the system.
The second part is like a moving day! If you have important data from another place, we bring it here so you can practice before everything goes live.

Once your playground is ready, we'll send you a secret code (login credentials) so you can enter and explore whenever you want. Let the fun begin!


To make sure everything is safe and follows the rules, everyone who wants to use our service goes through some checks. These checks help us say 'yes' to creating an account for them. It usually doesn't take more than 24 hours for us to say 'thumbs up' and get everything set up.


### Connecting with Lithobase APIs

Getting our APIs to work with your systems is a big deal! 

First, we'll give you special keys (like secret codes) on the test console to make sure everything is super secure.

Next, we'll be your guide through the different APIs that fit what you want to do. We'll show you the best ones and share detailed instructions on how to set them up for the best results. Our team will stick with you, making sure you have all the info and help you need to smoothly connect Lithobase APIs with your systems and ways of doing things.


### System Setup

Next up: system setup! We'll provide a template for your organization to fill out with important details. This helps us set everything up just right to match what your organization needs. The template covers things like:

- Office arrangements
- Chart of accounts
- Product settings
- Roles and permissions for everyone
- Employee info
- Names and roles of specific system users in your organization

If there are any unique data / details that aren't in our standard system, no worries! We can create custom fields using Data tables, letting you personalize the console to perfectly fit your business. Check out data tables for more info.


### Data Migration Procedure

Data migration involves the seamless transfer of pre-existing data from a prior system to the Lithobase core banking system. This process is particularly critical for users possessing pre-established customer datasets.

As previously outlined, the provisioning of a tenant includes the establishment of two test environments. The primary test environment facilitates user testing and system familiarization. The secondary test environment is specifically designated for executing the migration of data into Lithobase's core banking application. The timeline for data migration is contingent upon the volume of data slated for transfer.

For further insights into the intricacies of data migration, please refer to the detailed information provided in the Data migration section.


## Training Session and Security Overview


After configuring the system and granting access to your team, our support crew will guide you through training sessions. These sessions cover all the features and functions of the console, ensuring you know how to use it effectively. It's also a chance to review your customized console and make sure everything is set up just the way you want it.

### Security Measures:

Your data's safety is a big deal to us. We've set up a top-notch security system that includes multi-factor authentication through third-party authenticators. This means, to log in, you'll need to use a One-Time Password for an extra layer of security. We'll walk you through this process during the session, explaining how it works and sharing the best security practices.

### Go Live!
Once everything is in order, your tenant is officially launched! The data from the test environment moves into production, and you're ready to roll. But hey, it's not goodbye â€“ our support team is always here to help if you need anything.

### Authentication Process:

When logging in for the first time, we'll automatically send your URL and login details via email. Lithobase uses multi-factor authentication (MFA or 2FA) for added security. This means you'll need to use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or any other on your mobile device. It's an extra layer of protection, making sure only authorized users get access.
