# Setting Up and Getting Ready

Lithobase Console is like a magical tool that helps your organization do important things with money. To make it work just right for you, there are a few steps to follow:

## 1. Office Setup:

Imagine your organization is like a big tree with branches. The office setup is like giving each branch a special place. For example, if your organization is called Bank ABC and has branches in different cities, like Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Kano, you'd set up each branch to have its own space in the Lithobase Console. The main office is like the biggest branch, and you set it up first.


To do this:

Go to Utilities > System configs in the console.
Click on Manage Offices to add a new office or edit existing ones.


## 2. Product Configurations:

Think of products like different kinds of treats you offer. Lithobase helps you set up rules for these treats, like how much they cost, who can get them, and other important details.


## 3. Employees and Users:

Employees are like the workers in your organization, and users are special workers who get access to the Lithobase Console. During onboarding, a list of employees is sent to Lithobase. Later, you can give some of them special access.


## 4. Roles and Permissions:

Roles are like different job titles, and permissions are like the tasks each job can do. For example, a loan officer might be able to approve loans. Lithobase sets up basic roles, and you can create more.

## 5. Chart of Accounts:

This is like a list of all the money stuff your organization does. Lithobase helps you organize and track everything.

## 6. Data Tables:

Lithobase comes with some fields by default, but if your organization needs special ones, like extra details about clients or specific tasks, you can create custom fields.

## 7. Maker Checker Task:

Imagine two friends, one who suggests doing something, and another who checks to make sure it's a good idea. This is like the Maker Checker task. Lithobase lets you set up this double-check system for extra safety.

## 8. Data Migration:
When you bring in data from your old system to Lithobase, it's called data migration. Lithobase makes it easy to import your customer information, account details, and more using Excel.

## 9. Tier:

Tiers are like special groups with limits. For example, you might have a group with a limit on how much money they can take out or keep in their accounts. Lithobase helps you set up these limits.

Remember, each step helps Lithobase understand how your organization works, making it a perfect fit for you! ðŸš€
