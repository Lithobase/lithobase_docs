## How can you use Lithobase

You can use Lithobase by accessing:

The Lithobase Console is like your command center for all things banking. It's a user-friendly interface where organizations can easily set up, keep an eye on, and handle their everyday banking tasks. No need to start from scratch â€“ you can tweak and personalize the console to match your banking needs. It's your go-to for efficient services, with all transaction and customer data neatly organized in one place.

Think of Lithobase APIs as the magic wand for full-fledged banking operations. These APIs open up a world of possibilities, allowing users to do a bunch of cool stuff like creating customers, setting up accounts, managing loans and deposits, and configuring the system. We've got a handy API reference that spills all the details â€“ from endpoints to authorization â€“ to get you started in no time.

- 3. Combo Moves (APIs + Console):

Sometimes, you need both the API and the Console to work together seamlessly. Take generating API keys, for example â€“ it happens on the Console and is then used by the API for authentication. For more on this, check out the User Module â€“ it's your guide to mastering the perfect combo move."
