# Customer Component

### Who is a Customer?

Welcome to the bustling marketplace of Lithobase, a place where every person or group who visits your stall (organization) is a valued customer, each with their own unique story. In this marketplace, customers are not just accounts; they're like characters in a grand tale, each with their own name and a story to tell, woven into the fabric of your business.


## The Tale of Two Customers
In the world of Lithobase, there are two main types of customers who visit your marketplace: the individual wanderers and the mighty entities.

1. The Individual Wanderers (Individual Customers): Picture a lone traveler like Yinka Ajayi, who comes to your stall. He's an individual customer, a single character with his own account. He might be interested in your various treasures – savings, loans, or perhaps the mysterious fixed deposits.

2. The Mighty Entities (Entity Customers): Then, there are groups like guilds or teams, who come together under one banner. These are your entity customers – businesses, organizations, or even a band of adventurers sharing a joint account. They pool their resources and share the spoils, be it in savings or loans.


## The Customer Module: Your Ledger of Tales

This module is like a magical ledger where you create, edit, update, and manage the accounts of all the characters who visit your marketplace. Each entry in this ledger is a story of a customer's journey with your organization.

### Creating a Customer: The Beginning of a New Tale

Let's embark on the adventure of creating a new customer in your ledger:

1. Gather the Tale (Customer Information): Start by collecting the story of your customer – their name, and the unique threads that connect them to your marketplace.

3. Weave the Story (Account Creation): With all the details at hand, begin weaving their story into your ledger, creating an account that will grow and evolve with your marketplace.

And there you have it – the art of recognizing and cherishing each customer in the vibrant world of Woodcore, where every account is a story, and every customer is a character in the grand narrative of your organization. Let the tales unfold!
