# Managing Customers

## Mastering Customer Management on the Woodcore Console

Welcome to the control center of your financial universe! Here's your ultimate guide to navigating the stars of customer management in Woodcore.

### Galactic Search: Finding Your Financial Stars

Your console is equipped with a cosmic search tool, making it a breeze to locate any customer in your galaxy. Just enter their name, account number, or external ID into the search box. Remember, the 'Account Number' here is like a unique star code (Customer Information File number) for each customer.

### Customer Portfolio: Your Financial Galaxy at a Glance

Dive into the universe of your customer's financial accounts. From savings constellations to loan galaxies and fixed deposit nebulae, get a holistic view of their financial universe. It's like having a telescope that shows you every planet and star in a customer's financial sky.

### Updating Customers: Steering Their Financial Journey

Need to change the course of a customer's journey? Woodcore makes it easy:

1. Select the customer star you want to update.
2. Navigate to the 'Profile' section on the right.
3. Update the fields like adjusting the dials of your spaceship and hit 'Submit'.

### Assigning/Unassigning Staff: Your Crew Members
Assign a crew member (employee) to guide each customer on their financial journey. If a customer is flying solo (no staff assigned), you can easily assign a navigator:

1. Go to the 'Profile' section of the customer's details.
2. Click 'Options', then 'Assign Staff'.
3. Choose a crew member from the dropdown and confirm.

Need to change the crew? Unassigning is just as easy!

### Data Table on Customer Profile: Customizing Your Space Map

Woodcore's data table is like adding new constellations to your space map. Create custom fields for unique information like Bank Verification Numbers or next of kin – it's like charting new stars in your customer's sky.

### Editing Tiers: Adjusting Financial Orbits

Each customer orbits at a certain tier, setting their financial limits. Need to adjust their orbit? Just hit the 'Edit tier' button, select a new level, and submit. It's like recalibrating their path in your financial universe.

And there you have it – your guide to mastering the art of customer management in the Woodcore cosmos. Navigate, update, and customize with ease, and watch your financial galaxy thrive!
