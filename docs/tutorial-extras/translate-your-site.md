# User profile

Welcome to the magical world of Lithobase, where your user profile is like a personal spellbook, filled with all the secrets and powers you possess in this digital kingdom. Let's take a magical tour through it!

- Your Spellbook (User Profile): This enchanted book contains everything about your journey in Lithobase – your unique user ID, your wizard name (username), your office (your magical guild), your status in the realm, the language you speak, your email (your owl post address), your role (like being a knight or a mage), and your permissions (the spells you can cast).

- Finding Your Spellbook: To peek into your spellbook, simply click on the mystical dropdown icon in the profile view. It's like opening a treasure chest – see the shining section in the image below.

## Changing Your Magic Words (Password):

Why Change?: Sometimes, you need to change the magic words that protect your spellbook. Maybe they're too simple, or you just want to keep your powers extra safe.

- The Ritual: In your spellbook, under the Profile section, find and click the “Change Password” charm on the right side of the screen.

- The New Spell: A magical window will appear. Here, you'll whisper your current magic words (current password), then conjure up new ones (new password), and repeat them for confirmation (confirm new password).

- Seal the Spell: Hit the “Submit” button to lock in your new magic words.

What Happens Next?: As soon as you change your magic words, the gates of Woodcore will close, and you'll be outside. Don't worry! Just use your new magic words (password) to re-enter the kingdom.

- Lost Your Magic Words?: Fear not! If you forget your magic words, you can always reset them. Just consult the Reset Password guide – it's like a map to finding lost treasures.

Viewing Your Magical Powers (Roles and Permissions):

Your Role and Powers: In Lithobase, every wizard, knight, or adventurer (user) is given a role, and with each role comes special powers (permissions).

Discovering Your Powers: To see the extent of your magical abilities, open your spellbook (user profile) and tap on the "Permissions" tab. Here, you'll see a list of all the spells and actions you're allowed to perform in the Woodcore kingdom.

And there you have it – a guide to understanding and navigating your user profile in the enchanting world of Woodcore. Remember, your user profile is your personal guide to your journey here, so keep it safe and explore all the powers and secrets it holds!

## Roles and Permissions.

Welcome to the grand theater of Roles and Permissions in the world of Lithobase, where every user is like an actor on a stage, each playing a unique part defined by their role. Let's take a journey behind the scenes to see how this fascinating play unfolds!

### Roles: The Characters of Our Story

Think of a role as a costume that a user wears, defining their character in our organization's story. Each costume comes with its own set of tools and abilities – these are the permissions. When a role is crafted, like a tailor making a costume, it comes with specific permissions that define what the user can do.

- A Tale of Roles: Imagine a role for credit officers in our financial theater. They wear costumes that allow them to create loan accounts and analyze customers’ financial tales. However, their costume doesn't include the ability to approve cash requests or juggle teller transactions – those are for different characters in our play.

Creating a Role: The Costume Workshop

- Start Your Design: In the navigation pane, click on the 'Users' section.
Choose Your Fabric: Select the 'Role Management' tab.
Craft the Costume: Click on the 'Add Role' button.
Final Touches: Click 'Submit' to bring your new role to life.
Deleting a Role: The Costume Archive
Sometimes, a costume is no longer needed. But beware, you can't discard a costume that's still being worn! Ensure no user is wearing the role before you send it to the archives.

- To Archive a Costume: Click on the 'Delete' button in the Roles and Management tab.
Enable/Disable a Role: The Costume Rack
Instead of sending a costume to the archives, you can simply hang it up for a while. Disable a role when it's not in use, and re-enable it when the script calls for it again.

- Managing Permissions: The Tailor’s Touch
Permissions are like the accessories and tools that come with each costume. They define what each character can do in our play.

### Adding Accessories to a Costume:

Select Your Tools: In the navigation pane, go to the 'Users' section.
Visit the Costume Room: Select the 'Role Management' tab.
Choose Your Accessories: Click on 'View', then 'Edit' to add permissions to the role.
Customize: Select the permissions you want to add. You can choose everything with 'Select All' or remove all with 'Deselect All'.
And there you have it – the art of creating, managing, and customizing roles and permissions in the grand play of Woodcore. Each role is crucial, each permission a tool, making our organization's story a masterpiece of collaboration and efficiency!"
