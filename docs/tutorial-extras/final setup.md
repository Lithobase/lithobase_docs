# User Management

Welcome to the bustling town of Lithobase, where managing your townsfolk (users) is an adventure filled with quests and magical tools. Let's embark on a journey through the User Management realm, where you, as the town's guardian, have the power to oversee and guide your people.

### The Quest of Searching for Townsfolk (Search User)

In the bustling streets of Lithobase, you can find any townsfolk using the magical search function in the User Management tab. Just whisper a name, email, or office into the search box, and voilÃ  â€“ the person you seek appears!

### The Magic of Creating Keys (Generate an API Key)

For your tech wizards (programmatic users), you can forge magical keys (API keys) in the console. Remember, a wizard can only forge this key thrice. To create this key:

- Venture to the 'Users & API mgt' tab in the Users section.
- Select a wizard's details.
- In their profile, find and press the 'Generate API key' button.
- Name your key and hit 'Generate'.

Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰ You've successfully crafted a magical API key.

### The Art of Transformation (Update a User)

Sometimes, your townsfolk need a change â€“ a new title or role. As the guardian, you or another with the 'Manage Users' power can update their details.

- In the 'Users & API mgt' tab, select a townsfolk.
- In their profile, find the 'More' dropdown and choose 'Edit Profile'.
- After making changes, confirm them with the 'Submit' button.
- To change their secret word (password), select 'Change Password' from the same menu and update.

### The Solemn Decision (Delete User)
There comes a time when you must say farewell to a townsfolk. Be certain of this choice, as it's irreversible.

- In the 'Users & API mgt' tab, select the townsfolk.
- In their profile, choose 'Delete' from the 'More' dropdown.
- Confirm your decision on the delete modal page.

### The Rescue Mission (User Password Reset)

When a townsfolk forgets their secret word (password), a Superuser â€“ a special guardian with extra powers â€“ can initiate a rescue mission (password reset).

- The Superuser navigates to 'Users > User & API Management'.
- They select the troubled townsfolk.
- From the 'More' dropdown, they choose 'Reset Password'.
- After a confirmation prompt, the request is sent, and a magical email helps the townsfolk reset their secret word.

And thus, your journey in the realm of User Management in Lithobase is filled with quests of searching, creating, transforming, deciding, and rescuing. Each action you take shapes the story of your town and its people. Good luck, brave guardian!



# Employee Module

Welcome to the bustling village of Woodcore, where every villager (employee) plays a unique role in the tapestry of our community. Some villagers are also magical users, wielding the powers of the Woodcore console or API, while others contribute in different, yet equally important ways.

## The Tale of John, the Security Attendant

Let's take John, for instance. He's our trusty security attendant, always on the lookout, keeping our village safe. John is a valued member of our community, and we record his details in the Great Book of Villagers (the employee module). However, John doesn't need the magical tools of the Lithobase console or API for his daily tasks, so he's not set up as a user in those mystical realms.

## The Great Book of Villagers (Employee Module)

This book is like a directory of everyone in our village. It's where we keep track of all our villagers, whether they're users of Lithobase's magic or not. When we do need to grant someone access to the magical console or API, their details from the Great Book make it easy to transform them into users.

### Adding a New Villager (Employee)

To welcome a new villager into our community, follow these steps:

- In the console, navigate to the 'Users > Employee mgt' tab.
- Click on the 'New User' button to open the 'Create Employee' form.

Filling the Villager's Details:

- Portrait (Profile Image): Optionally, upload a portrait of the villager.
- Village Branch (Office): Select the branch of our village where the villager works.
- Name: Write down the villager's first and last name.
- Loan Officer: If the villager is to be a loan officer, responsible for managing customer loans, tick this box.
- Status: Choose whether the villager is active (available) or inactive (on a break).
- Raven Number (Mobile Number): Enter the villager's raven number for sending messages.
- Date Joined: Mark the calendar with the date the villager joined our community.

Finally, press the 'Submit' button to officially welcome the new villager.

And there you have it! The process of adding a villager in Lithobase is a blend of practicality and magic, ensuring that each member of our community, whether a magical user or not, is recognized and valued. Welcome to the village!
