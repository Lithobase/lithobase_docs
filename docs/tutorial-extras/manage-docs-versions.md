# What is user is to Lithobase.

Imagine you've just stepped into the world of Lithobase, a place where every individual is a unique user, much like characters in a video game. 

In this world, there are two kinds of adventurers: 

- those who explore through the API, like wizards using their magic spells, 
- and those who navigate using the console, akin to warriors with their trusty swords.

As you embark on your journey in Lithobase, you'll discover that your powers – or rather, your access to various features and information – are shaped by the role you're assigned. Think of these roles as special cloaks you wear, each granting you unique abilities to perform specific tasks. The more powerful your cloak, the more permissions you have.

Now, let's turn a page to an important chapter in our story: the onboarding process. When your organization joins the Lithobase realm, our support team, much like a group of friendly wizards, will conjure up a new console environment for you. They'll also introduce a key character – the account owner. This person is the hero of your organization's story in Lithobase, holding all the powers and never fading into the shadows.

But what if this hero needs to pass on their cloak to another? In such cases, the former hero must weave a new tale by updating the user details to those of the new account owner. This new hero will then receive a magical confirmation email and will set a new password to begin their own saga.

Beware, though! If the tale of the account owner isn't updated in time and the magic link to their email is lost, fear not. Our support team, ever-ready to assist, will help you reclaim your story.

In the next chapter of our adventure, we'll guide you through the mystical process of creating a user and delve into the secrets of user management operations. Stay tuned, for the journey in Woodcore is full of surprises and learning!

## Create a User.

Let's embark on a journey through the land of Lithobase, a place where every employee in your organization can transform into a 'user', gaining special access to the magical realms of the Lithobase API or console. Think of it as a secret door to a hidden world, and you're about to learn how to create the key!

First, imagine yourself as a wizard with the power to create new users. You begin your spell at the mystical console. Here’s how you weave your magic:

### The Portal to Creation: 

Start your journey by navigating to the mystical 'Users > Users & API mgt' tab on your console. It's like finding the map to a hidden treasure.

### Summoning the New User:

Click on the 'New User' button. This is like opening a secret book that reveals a form – the spell you need to bring a new user to life.

### Crafting the User:

Office: Choose the branch of your magical office where this user belongs.

Staff: Remember, every user starts as a staff, a member of your organization. They're like characters in our story who need to be written in first. Select a staff member, and like magic, their details – first name, last name, and email – will appear, pulled from the depths of existing employee records. (Psst... check the 'Employee' section in your magical guidebook for more on creating an employee.)

Username: This is the secret name your user will use to enter the world of Lithobase. Choose wisely!

Access: In Lithobase, there are two paths – programmatic, where users can command the API with an API key, and console, where they navigate the user interface. Choose the path your user will walk.

Role: Here, you assign the powers and duties your user will have. A user can wear multiple hats, so feel free to choose more than one role. Just make sure these roles exist in your spell book before you start.

The Final Spell: With all the details in place, hit the 'Submit' button.

Congratulations, you've just created a new user!

The Confirmation Ritual: After your spell is complete, a confirmation owl – I mean, email – will fly out to your new user. It carries their username, account ID, and a magical link to set their password. Once they click this link and set their password, they're ready to step into the world of Woodcore!

And there you have it, the magical process of creating a user in the enchanting world of Lithobase. Each step is an important part of the spell, so follow them carefully and watch as your team grows stronger with each new user you create!
