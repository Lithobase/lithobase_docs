# Deposit Account Lifecycle

Understanding the Deposit Account Lifecycle

The journey of a deposit account in your system is like a story with distinct chapters. Each chapter, or stage, involves specific actions that transform the account from a mere entry in your database to an active participant in financial transactions.

Here's a breakdown of the three main stages in the deposit account lifecycle:

Account Creation: This is where the account's story begins. It's created but not yet ready for action.

Approve Account: Give the green light for the account, setting it up for activation.
Modify Account: Make any necessary tweaks to the account details.
Unassign Staff: Remove a staff member previously linked to the account.
Reject Account: Decide not to proceed with the account creation.
Withdrawn by Client: The customer decides to cancel the account creation.
Add Charge: Apply additional charges to the account.
Delete Account: Completely cancel the account application.
Approval: This stage is like a checkpoint, ensuring everything is set correctly before activation.

Undo Approval: Change your mind? You can reverse the account's approval.
Reject: Decide not to approve the account after all.
Withdrawn by Client: Again, the customer can choose to cancel at this stage.
Add Charge: Apply any last-minute charges before activation.
Activation: The account is now ready to join the financial world.

Activate: The account is now active and ready for transactions.
Unassign Staff: Remove a staff member from the account.
Post Interest: Add any earned interest to the account.
Add Charge: Implement charges for account maintenance or services.
Generate Statement: Create a statement for the account's activities.
Transfer Funds: Move funds in or out of the account.
Block Account: Temporarily suspend the account for security or other reasons.
Activate PND (Post No Debit): Put temporary restrictions on the account.
Remember, each action you take can change the account's status, and sometimes you might need to revert to a previous stage, like undoing an approval. It's a dynamic process, ensuring that every account is accurately set up and managed.
