# Deposit Component

Start with Deposit Products on Lithobase

Deposit products in Lithobase are like templates for your deposit offerings. They let you set the rules and features for different types of deposits you want to offer your customers. Once you create a deposit product, all the accounts opened under it will follow the same set of rules.

For instance, if you create a 'Student Savings' product with a 2% annual interest rate, every account opened under this product will automatically have the same interest rate.

There are two main types of deposit products: Savings Products and Fixed Deposit Products.

Creating a Deposit Product is Easy:

- Go to the Utilities section in the navigation panel.
- Click on Products. This opens the Products menu.

Remember, while most features you set for a deposit product apply to all accounts under it, some things like withdrawal and overdraft limits can be adjusted individually for each account.

Stay tuned for more details on how these products work in the next section!
